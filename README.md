**R**eduction by **P**rior **A**nimal **I**nformed **R**esearch (*RePAIR*) is a statistical tool to limit the number of animals to conduct well-powered research. This github project accompanies the homonymous manuscript, which can be downloaded at [this link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/864652v1).

## Getting started
To get started: 

* run the *dependencies.R* script, with which you can automatically download all required packages.
* run the *download_data.R* to download data directly from the openscience framework. 

<br>
**<u>Attention:</u>** 
<br>
The **package osfr** here used to download data directly from the [repository](http/:osf.io) is currently being developed. If automatic download does not work, copy the data files found at [this link](https://osf.io/wvs7m/) to the *data/raw/* folder in your directory. The files names are: 

* meta_effectsize.csv
* meta_n.csv
* RELACS_anonymized_blinded.csv
* RELACS_prior_control_literature.csv


## Brief description of R scripts
The analysis is coded in 6 different R scripts: 

* **RePAIR_functions.R**: sourced by all other R scripts, it contains libraries, functions, paths and other general variables (e.g. color codes)
* **power_literature.R**: descriptive analysis and estimation of statistical power in preclinical literature. It outputs all relevant information for Figure 1 and 2C of the manuscript, as well as several supplementary figures.
* **RePAIR_simulation.R**: script of the simulation study to study the relationship between between prior, sample size and prospective statistical power. It outputs a .csv file containing the output of the simulation, and a graph for its visualization (Figure 2A of the manuscript). 
* **RePAIR_sensitivity.R**: sensitivity simulation to validate the robustity of RePAIR. It outputs a csv file with the output of the sensitivity simulation study, as well as a graph for its visualization (Supplementary Figure 5 of the manuscript).
* **RePAIR_prior.R**: analysis of the prior literature selected to gather information for the sensitivity analysis (conducted with script *RePAIR_sensitivity.R*).
* **RePAIR_relacs.R**: tryout of RePAIR on a real life dataset (RELACS). It outputs Figure 2B as well as well as other supplementary information.
